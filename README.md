<h1>Nessus: Vulnerbaility Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>What is Nessus?</h3>
Nessus is one of the worldâ€™s most widely used remote security scanning tools. It was designed by Tenable to help organizations discover any security vulnerabilities that may exist within their networks, systems, web applications, and other infrastructure components. It is open source, provides patching assistance, and is extensible. It also provides a scripting language and a personal plug-in site. 

<h3>How does Nessus work?</h3>
It works by testing the many ports that computers use to communicate with one another. These ports communicate with servers using high-level protocols which transmit data via UDP or TCP stream. Computers have thousands of ports which may or may not be in use. Nessus checks each of them for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. 

<h3>Functions:</h3>

- Network Vulnerability Scanning
- Web Application Scanning
- Cloud Infrastructure Scanning 
- Mobile Device Scanning
- Aent-Based Scanning
- Policy Compliance Auditing
- Extensive Vulnerability Database
- Customizable Scanning Policy
- Remediation Guidance
- Integration and Automation
