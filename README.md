<h1>Nessus: Vulnerbaility Management Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>What is Nessus?</h3>
Nessus is one of the worldâ€™s most widely used remote security scanning tools. It was designed by Tenable to help organizations discover any security vulnerabilities that may exist within their networks, systems, web applications, and other infrastructure components. It is open source, provides patching assistance, and is extensible. It also provides a scripting language and a personal plug-in site. 

<h3>How does Nessus work?</h3>
It works by testing the many ports that computers use to communicate with one another. These ports communicate with servers using high-level protocols which transmit data via UDP or TCP stream. Computers have thousands of ports which may or may not be in use. Nessus checks each of them for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors. 

<h3>Functions:</h3>

- Network Vulnerability Scanning
- Web Application Scanning
- Cloud Infrastructure Scanning 
- Mobile Device Scanning
- Aent-Based Scanning
- Policy Compliance Auditing
- Extensive Vulnerability Database
- Customizable Scanning Policy
- Remediation Guidance
- Integration and Automation

<br />
Configure the network adapters with information from the network diagram. The server will use itself as a DNS. <br/>

<br />
Install Active Directory Domain Service.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Create the domain. For example, this project uses companydomain.com. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Within the domain, create an Organizational Unit named _ADMIN. Then create your first admin and give it privileges.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Install RAS/NAT services and enable IPv4 routing. This will allow clients on the private network to access the internet using the Domain Controller. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Install DHCP services and configure the scope of IP addresses that will leased. This will allow users that join the domain to automatically be assigned private IP addresses.<br/>

<br />
Use PowerShell to create 1000 users to imitate a corporate environment. You will need to disable security features to enable the use of the script provided in this lab.   <br/>

<br />
<br />
Log onto one of the generated users. Ping www.google.com to make sure the user can access the internet. Ping the domain created earlier in the lab to make sure it can be accessed. Run ipconfig and make sure the IP address is within the specified scope. <br/>

<br />
<br />
Add the user to the domain using the credential of the admin account created earlier in the lab.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Check the DHCP server and make sure there is a lease for the user that was just added to the domain.  <br/>
